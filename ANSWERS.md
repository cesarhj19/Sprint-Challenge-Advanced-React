- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
	- If you need to keep the state you would use classes because they offer more functionality and functions are stateless components
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
	- Mounting Phase = componentWillMount() - component is being built and the render method is invoked
